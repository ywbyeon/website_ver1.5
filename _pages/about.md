I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate, and I am broadly interested in synthesizing/investigating/analyzing materials for energy storaging devices. My current work is focused on developing all-solid-state batteries that have both a long cycle life and a high energy density by designing and integrating materials. My expertise is in material analysis based on electron microscopy (TEM, FIB, and SEM) and X-ray analysis (XRD, XPS, and XANES). I am currently based in the Materials Sciences Division at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov) (Berkeley, CA, USA).

I hold a Ph.D. in Materials Sciences and Engineering from [Korea University](https://www.korea.ac.kr) (Seoul, South Korea). I have also been a Research Assistant at the [Advanced Analysis Center](https://aac.kist.re.kr) of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology ([KIST](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng)). I have had a multidisciplinary experience working with materials for electrochemical applications, including the alloying anodes (e.g., Si, Sn, and Sb), Fuel cells (PEMFC), and the composite cathodes in Li- and Na-ion batteries, and the solid electrolytes for all-solid-state Li metal batteries.

Also I have been investigating the relationship between synthesis parameters and the material properties of the reaction product that control the activity and degradations of electrochemical reactions for energy storage materials.
