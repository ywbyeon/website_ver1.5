Welcome to my personal website! I am a passionate and dedicated Senior Research Scientist currently serving at [Advanced Analysis and Data Center](https://aac.kist.re.kr) at [Korea Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kist.re.kr) (Seoul, South Korea). With a deep-rooted interest in advancing scientific understanding and technology, I embarked on my journey with KIST in Nov. 2023, embracing the challenges and innovations in materials science.

### My Journey

My academic and professional journey has been a mosaic of rigorous research, collaborative projects, and continuous learning. I hold a Ph.D. in Materials Sciences and Engineering from [Korea University](https://www.korea.ac.kr) (Seoul, South Korea). After the Ph.D. courses, I have spent several years delving into the complexities of material properties and their implications in various applications at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov) (LBNL). I have had multidisciplinary experience working with materials for electrochemical applications, including the alloying anodes (e.g., Si, Sn, and Sb), Fuel cells (PEMFC), and composite cathodes in Li- and Na-ion batteries, and the solid electrolytes for all-solid-state Li metal batteries. My experiences have sharpened my technical skills and honed my ability to think critically and solve complex problems.

### Current Focus

At KIST, my work revolves around developing cutting-edge analysis techniques, with a special emphasis on transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This fascinating tool lets us peek into materials' atomic and molecular realms, offering insights crucial for scientific advancement. My current research primarily focuses on leveraging TEM's capabilities to aid in developing innovative energy storage materials. The goal is to design efficient, durable, and environmentally sustainable materials.

### Vision and Collaboration

I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and interdisciplinary research. The complex challenges of today's world require a synergistic approach, combining knowledge from different fields to achieve breakthroughs. I am always open to collaborative opportunities and discussions that can lead to new insights and discoveries.

### Beyond the Lab

Outside the lab, I am an avid reader and enjoy exploring the latest advancements in science and technology. I also enjoy mentoring young scientists and engaging in community outreach programs to foster a love for science in the next generation.

### Let's Connect

I am enthusiastic about connecting with fellow researchers, industry professionals, and anyone interested in materials science and electron microscopy. Feel free to contact me for collaborations, discussions, or even a casual chat about science.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to the potential of our paths crossing in the fascinating world of scientific discovery.
